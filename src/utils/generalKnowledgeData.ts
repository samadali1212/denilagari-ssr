A die from 1891 was modified by adding a '9' over the '1' in the date, creating the famous 'Single 9' coin. Only one example is known to exist, currently housed in the Mint of South Africa's collection, making it essentially priceless. If it were ever to come to auction, experts estimate it could fetch millions of Rand, making it one of the most valuable coins in the world.",
