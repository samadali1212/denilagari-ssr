Bipasha Basu, aka \"Bips\", is an Indian beauty who started her professional career as a model, but then ventured into films and made her name as an actress in Telugu, Bengali and Tamil language films. The fact that her debutant role as a foe in the 2001 movie Ajnabee earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, was a clear sign that she made the right choice. However, Basu's commercial success came after her appearance in Raaz (2002), which was followed by more media exposure once she rendered a bold part in the erotic 2003 movie Jism. Next, she played parts in major movies such as No Entry(2005), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Dhoom 2 (2006) and Race (2008), and in movies like Apharan (2005), Corporate (2006) and Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008) that earned her critical claim and gave her a chance for several award nominations.",
