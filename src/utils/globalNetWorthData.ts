Bipasha Basu, aka \"Bips\", is an Indian beauty who started her professional career as a model, but then ventured into films and made her name as an actress in Telugu, Bengali and Tamil language films. The fact that her debutant role as a foe in the 2001 movie Ajnabee earned her a Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut, was a clear sign that she made the right choice. However, Basu's commercial success came after her appearance in Raaz (2002), which was followed by more media exposure once she rendered a bold part in the erotic 2003 movie Jism. Next, she played parts in major movies such as No Entry(2005), Phir Hera Pheri (2006), Dhoom 2 (2006) and Race (2008), and in movies like Apharan (2005), Corporate (2006) and Bachna Ae Haseeno (2008) that earned her critical claim and gave her a chance for several award nominations.",

As DJs, they ran into what must be a somewhat familiar problem: They found themselves running out of hip hop tracks to play during shows. So, in a somewhat unique solution, they began recording their own tracks, which eventually led to the formation of their own record label called Diamond Records. After finding some success in several tours, they decided to change their name to The Chemical Brothers.",

Often seen on the covers of Italian Vogue or in Prada commercials, she was surrounded by controversy in 2008 when she posed nude in a pictorial for the French edition of Playboy. This negative publicity turned a good thing as Cole became more ever-present than ever. Also, it didn't take her much to translate her modeling success on the big screen. While her looks launched her career into the fashion stratosphere, Cole's grace and acumen were the ones to fetch her plaudits from notable movie makers like Terry Gilliam.",

While the age of consent in France is 15, prostitution is only legal if the prostitute is over the age of 18. The investigation began in 2010 just before the French team participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup and involved both players. The scandal brought much attention to the young Dehar and she was soon notorious. The players were facing up to three years in prison and hefty fines, while Dehar would face no charges, as prostituting in itself is not a crime under French law.",
